## Description

Rocks are a fundamental component of the Earth, and their automatic identification in the field plays a crucial role in geological surveying, education, and automatic mapping. This process is essential for geological research and mineral resource exploration. Due to the challenging conditions in the field, rock identification often relies on visual methods, including the use of a magnifying glass for fine-grained specimens. Visual inspection evaluates attributes such as color, composition, grain size, and structure, which reflect the rock's mineral and chemical composition, formation environment, and origin. For example, the color of a rock provides insights into its chemical makeup. However, traditional identification methods can be time-consuming. To address this, image-based analysis using deep convolutional neural networks has shown promising results in accurately identifying rock types directly from field images. This paper presents a robust approach leveraging deep learning for precise and efficient rock type classification.
